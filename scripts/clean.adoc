= Spring Cloud Data Flow Acceptance Tests - Clean =

Cleaning the AT environment undeploys the Data Flow and Skipper servers and any remaining test apps.
This script also removes any dependent resources.
You have the option to keep dependent services, e.g., message broker and mysql, to save time if they can be used for subsequent test runs.

== How to run it

`clean.sh`  must be run from the project root. The easiest way is:

```
./run.sh clean <args>
```

which simply invokes `clean.sh` with the given args.
Alternately, you can run it standalone from the project root:
```
./scripts/clean.sh <args>
```

```
USAGE: clean.sh -p <PLATFORM> -b <BINDER> [--schedulesEnabled]
  This will cleanup any existing resources on the platform

Flags:
-p  | --platform - define the target platform to clean, defaults to local
-b  | --binder - define the binder to clean (i.e. RABBIT, KAFKA) defaults to RABBIT
-sc | --serverCleanup - run the cleanup for the SCDF/Skipper (along with the applications deployed but excluding the DB, message broker)
-se | --schedulesEnabled - cleans scheduling infrastructure if installed.
```
