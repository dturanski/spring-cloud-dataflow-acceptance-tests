= Spring Cloud Data Flow Acceptance Tests - Tests =

This script builds and runs the tests in the `src` directory using `mvn test`.
This includes clean up by default.
Cleanup can be disabled by setting -c  | --skipCleanup.

NOTE: This requires the environment to be properly installed and configured, typically by running `run.sh setup` first.
Platform specific environment variables must also be set.

== How to run it

`tests.sh`  must be run from the project root. The easiest way is:

```
./run.sh tests <args>
```

which simply invokes `tests.sh` with the given args.
Alternately, you can run it standalone from the project root:
```
./scripts/tests.sh <args>
```

```
USAGE: tests.sh -p <PLATFORM> -b <BINDER> [-d -cc -dv --tests]
  Run the acceptance tests.

Flags:
    -p  | --platform - define the target platform to run, defaults to local
    -b  | --binder - define the binder (i.e. RABBIT, KAFKA) defaults to RABBIT
    -dv | --dataflowVersion - set the dataflow client version to the same as the dataflow server (e.g. 2.5.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT)
    --tests - comma separated list of tests to run. Wildcards such as *http* are allowed (e.g. --tests TickTockTests#tickTockTests)
    -cc | --skipCloudConfig - skip the config server tests
    -se | --schedulesEnabled - includes schedule tests.
    -c  | --skipCleanup - skip the clean up phase
    -sc | --serverCleanup - run the cleanup for only SCDF and Skipper, along with the applications deployed but excluding the DB, message broker.
```
